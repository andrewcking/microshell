# microshell
The basic program operates by passing the inputted string into an array. It will not accept an empty string (array) as an argument. It parses the string by calling parse_cmd. I have a flag set, using an int, to detect if a command should be run in the background called bgflag. It is called by the command line by entering an ampersand as a separate word at the end of a string (eg ‘pwd &’). This causes the program to skip the waitpid call. The system can accept multiple lines of code, which it passes through to the command line via execvp.
